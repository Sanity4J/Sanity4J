For classes that only have static methods, consider making them utility classes. 
Note that this doesn't apply to abstract classes, since their subclasses may well 
include non-static methods. Also, if you want this class to be a utility class, 
remember to add a private constructor to prevent instantiation.

    <div class="source"><pre>
                

public class MaybeASingleton {
 public static void foo() {}
 public static void bar() {}
}
