			<p>The following diagram shows the graph produced by Sanity4J 
			for a Java Development Project. The project began by creating
			code quickly, with little regard for quality (green line). Sanity4J 
			reports were configured for the project and an 85% quality target 
			was set. Developers began to improve code quality by fixing issues 
			as the project progressed. Towards the go-live date, the team was 
			advised that their code would be subjected to an external review. 
			This caused an increased focus on quality which Sanity4J tracked.</p>

			<p>The external code review pointed out that the project had failed 
			to reach Departmental targets for automated unit tests, represented 
			by the red and blue lines. Prior to go-live, the project was able to 
			dramatically increase their level of automated unit testing and their 
			progress was tracked by Sanity4J.</p>
			
			<p><strong>The result was a higher quality product, which is estimated
			to cost much less to maintain in future years.</strong></p>
			
			<h3>Monitoring Progress</h3>
			
			<p>The information that Sanity4J tracks was available to developers, 
			project staff and the project executive throughout the development
			of the project. Sanity4J provided the ability to easily measure and 
			track quality. It is unlikely that the project would have achieved 
			such significant improvements without support from Sanity4J.</p>
